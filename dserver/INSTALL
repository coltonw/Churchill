Go to djangoproject.com follow the instructions to install django on your computer.

All you will have to do here to make this site work is copy the settings-base file to be "settings.py" and then edit some parts of it: the media root and the template root need to point to the directories here. 

Setup the database by typing:

python manage.py syncdb

Then you can start a server just by typing:

python manage.py runserver

by default it starts running that server at port 8000 so go to localhost:8000 on your browser and its game on.
